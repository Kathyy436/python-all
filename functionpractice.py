1. The "Nicknamer" 📛
Goal: Create a function that takes a first name and a last name and returns a "cool" combined nickname.
The Task: Write a function make_nickname(first, last).
The Logic:
Take the first 3 letters of the first name and the last 3 letters of the last name.
Combine them and return the answer.
Example: make_nickname("Taylor", "Swift") should return "Taysft".

"""
2. The Movie Ticket Calculator 🍿
Goal: Practice using if/else inside a function with a return value.
The Task: Write a function get_ticket_price(age).
The Logic:
If age is under 12, return £8.
If age is 12 to 18, return £10.
If age is over 18, return £15.
Bonus: Add a second parameter is_wednesday (boolean). If it's True, subtract £2 from any price!
"""

def  getTicketPrice(age):
    if age <12:
        return("£8")
    elif age >= 12 and age <18:
        return("£10")
    else:
        return("£15")

print(getTicketPrice(18))

"""
3. The "Emoji-ficator" 🤖
Goal: Map specific words to emojis using a function.
The Task: Write a function emojify(word).
The Logic: 
If the word is "happy", return "😊". 
If "fire", return "�C". 
If "pizza", return "🍕". 
If it doesn't recognize the word, return "❓".
Challenge: Create a loop that asks the user for a word and calls your function until they type "exit".
"""

def emojify(word):
    if(word == "happy"):
        return("😊")
    elif(word =="fire"):
        return("🔥")
    elif(word=="pizza"):
        return("🍕")

"""
4. The Geometry Hero 📐
Goal: Use math operators and multiple parameters.
The Task: Write a function calc_area(shape, length, width=0).
The Logic: 
If shape is "square", return length * length.
If shape is "rectangle", return length * width.
The Twist: Set a "default value" for width so the function doesn't crash if someone only provides one number for a square!
"""

    if(width == 
    if(shape == "square"):
